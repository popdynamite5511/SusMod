Stupid Minecraft Spigot server plugin that has a command that lets you kill yourself by spawning a creeper at your feet.
Requires Spigot for 1.12.2, however it can probably be run in Paper 1.12.2.

This is just a practice plugin that I made using a tutorial. I wouldn't recommend using this on a large server.
